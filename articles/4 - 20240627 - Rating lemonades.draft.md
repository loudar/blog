# Rating lemonades

Specifically, **lemon** lemonades.

For some reason - I actually don't really remember why - I started rating lemonades a couple of months back.

## Parameters

Every lemonade is rated based on six parameters:

- Sweetness 0-10
- Sourness 0-10
- Bitterness 0-10
- Sparkliness 0-10
- Taste (just my opinion, really) 0-10
- Price per 100ml in â‚¬

A combination of taste and price per 100 ml is then used to discern a final rating from 0-10.

This ensures that even if a lemonade is a 10 and would be considered best in taste, a high price would keep it from dominating the top of the list.
